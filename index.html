<p><img src="10print.gif" alt="an image generated from a version of the BASIC program 10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10"></p>
<p>This is an image I created by recreating in Python the BASIC program consisting entirely of one line of code:<br>
  10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10<br>
then running it, and importing the results into Photoshop, setting it in Avenir Next and adjusting linespacing and kerning, and giving it <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Color" target="_blank">Commodore 64-correct colors</a>.<br>
It's a program so concise and impressive there's <a href="https://10print.org" target="_blank">a book</a> about it.</p>
