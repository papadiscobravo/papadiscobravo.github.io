<p>To make the image above, I recreated in Python the BASIC program consisting entirely of one line of code:</p>
<p style="font-family:'Lucida Console', monospace">10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10</p>
<p>
Then I ran the Python program I wrote, copied results from Terminal, pasted into a text layer in Photoshop, set it in Avenir Next,
adjusted linespacing and kerning, and gave figure and ground <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Color" target="_blank">Commodore 64-correct colors</a>.
The original was a program so impressively concise there's <a href="https://10print.org" target="_blank">a book</a> about it:<br>
"Like a diary from the forgotten past, computer code is embedded with stories of a program's making, its purpose, its assumptions, and more."</p>
